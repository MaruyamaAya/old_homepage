Hi, I am a first-year CS Ph.D. student at [NUS](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), supervised by [Prof. Yang You](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~youy/) 
and work as a member of [HPC-AI lab](https://ai.comp.nus.edu.sg/).
I received my bachelor's degree of computer science and engineering at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) in 2020.

My research interest is machine learning system and high performance computing. I have been working on pipeline parallelism 
in deep learning training, and I am currently digging into large model inference and MoE model training/inference. I am looking 
forward to collaborations, so please feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in my research.

In my spare time, I enjoy watching animes and playing rhythm games (especially maimai) and board games. I also play the piano and once played keyboard
in an amateur band.

Check out more about me on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UPFptUwAAAAJ&hl=en), [Github](https://github.com/MaruyamaAya),

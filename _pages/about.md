Hi, I am a second-year CS Ph.D. candidate at [NUS](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), supervised by [Prof. Yang You](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~youy/) 
and work as a member of [HPC-AI lab](https://ai.comp.nus.edu.sg/).
Currently I am also an intern at Microsoft Research Asia [System Group (Shanghai)](https://www.msra.cn/zh-cn/msr-asia-shanghai), supervised by [Dr. Zhenhua Han](https://hzhua.github.io/).
I received my bachelor's degree of computer science and engineering at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) in 2020.

My research interest is machine learning system and high performance computing. I have been working on pipeline parallelism 
in deep learning training, and I am currently digging into long-sequence training for LLMs. I am looking 
forward to collaborations and research internship opportunities, so please feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in my research.

In my spare time, I enjoy watching anime, playing rhythm games (especially maimai) and board games. I also play the piano and once played keyboard
in an amateur band.
